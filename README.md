## Step 1: Random quotes
A random quotation or text generator is a tool that creates random fake quotes by assembling sentence fragments. 

One example is RandomTextGenerator. It's your turn to create one! You must respect the following criteria:

* The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call

* Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (it's up to you to create these sentence fragments: beginning, middle, and end)

* The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)

* The program can simply display each result in the JavaScript console.

## Step 2: More customized quotes
You now want to go further and offer the following options:

* Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)

* Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need two different sets of sentences)

Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
